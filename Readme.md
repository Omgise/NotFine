# NotFine

Extra video settings and performance improvements for Minecraft 1.7.10, implemented with Mixins.

For shader support see [Angelica](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Angelica) (WIP).

# Future Plans

- Several new video settings.
- More mod support for new leaf rendering modes.

# Requirements

- [UniMixins](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/UniMixins)

# Known Issues

- Always Translucent and Default(vanilla) cloud translucency will cause clouds to render over liquids.
- Some of the included MCPatcherForge modules have as of yet undiscovered bugs.

# Known Conflicts

- [Angelica](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Angelica) | Incompatible because Angelica includes NotFine.
- [Leaf Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/leafculling) | Incompatible due to overlap. Suggested if you just want "Smart" leaf rendering.
- Optifine | Cannot be made compatible.
